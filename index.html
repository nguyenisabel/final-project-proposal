            <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <h2>My idea for my final project is to create a Studio Ghibli themed cookbook website.</h2>
    
            <p id="intro">I've grown up with Studio Ghibli movies and the art style has always been an inspiration to me. Most people who have seen at least one of them would agree that the food depicted in these movies are beyond appetizing. I wanted to do a play on a restaurant / cookbook style website focused on the dishes featured in these movies. </p>
            <div id="group">
                <div id="left">
                    <img src="media/1.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <div id="right">
                    <p>I was thinking of doing a pretty straightforward homepage, that previewed the <i>films</i>, <i>meals</i>, and <i>all dishes</i> pages I included in the navigation bar. In the <i>films</i> tab, I plan on including the following movies as reference:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My Neighbor, Totoro</li>
                        <li>Spirited Away</li>
                        <li>Howl's Moving Castle</li>
                        <li>Kiki's Delivery Service</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This tab will include descriptions of each movie, as viewers can pick which universe they'd like to look at foods from. I was most inspired by the huge feast of food in Spirited Away and baked goods in Kiki's Delivery Service. However, in the case I have time or find dishes from other Studio Ghibli movies, I will of course include those as well. As for the <i>meals</i> tab, I plan on categorizing the meals on the basis of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Breakfast</li>
                        <li>Lunch</li>
                        <li>Dinner</li>
                        <li>Snacks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The dishes will be color coded based on the meals they fall under and hopefully I will be able to find high quality images of each. It would be cool to include background information on each dish if I can find information on them, since many of them are Japanese dishes true to the company's origins. I know that I will have a lot of fun playing around with the fonts, colors, and dynamics of this site as I hope to make the viewer feel as though they are immersed in the universe when looking for food inspiration and recipes.</p>
                    <p>As of right now, my resources consist of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bootstrap</li>
                        <li>Google and the Internet Archive [for images]</li>
                        <li>Youtube [for Studio Ghibli copycat recipes]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That's where my head is at right now with this project! As time goes on and I continue to work on it, my ideas will definitely grow and develop more. I have confidence that I will finish by the deadline. Thanks!</p>
